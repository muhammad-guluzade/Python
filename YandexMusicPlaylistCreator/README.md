# Yandex Music Playlist Creator

This is the program that first reads data from top 100 Billboard music hits in a particular period of time, and then stores the name of those music hits.

After storing the names, the program logs in using unique user id which can be obtained only if you have Yandex Music account and searches for playlist named "PythonPlaylist". It then searches for tracks using yandex API and saves the tracks that could be found into "Python Playlist".

You end up with a playlist of top 100 Billboard music hits in your Yandex Music account.
