# Words Game!

## What is it about? (Game Process)
This is the game where you can increase your vocabulary and learn some new words! You start off by typing in the prefix. Next, you have to type in every word that starts with that prefix that you can remember. If that word exists (which is checked using dictionary API), you score 1 point. When you press "END", the game will end and save the words that you have entered (the existing ones) into the text file which you can review.

In addition, you can press not only "enter" key to enter the word, but also "'" key (apostrophe). If you press apostrophe, the word you have entrered is going to be saved inside "to_learn.txt". This is done in case you did not know the meaning of the word you typed in, but it existed. 

Have fun playing this game!
